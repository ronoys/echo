            <p><b>Mission:</b> Our research hopes to explore the relationship between hearing, computation, and the brainâ€™s functions with a hypothesis that combines the three fields. How would improved algorithms for hearing aids compare to a psychological and neurological training program to improve the ability of hearing-impaired individuals to hear in high-difficulty areas? Thus far, we have determined that two approaches could come together for each part of this project. From a computational perspective on audio coherence, we could use signal processing techniques and machine learning to separate directed speech from noise and amplify it for a given listener. From a neurological perspective on audio coherence, we could develop a series of aural rehabilitation modules to help those with hearing impairments more effectively focus on audio from various directional and qualitative sources.

            <p><b>Project Scope:</b> The stakeholders connected to our research include the hearing-impaired community, businesses that make and sell hearing aids, doctors and other people involved in the medical field, and educators. The hearing-impaired community not only includes those who experience hearing loss themselves, but also their families and friends. Members who experience hearing loss themselves are impacted because they would directly experience improvements to existing hearing aids. Additionally, by providing members of the hearing-impaired community with another option for communication, we hope to help them find more ways to participate in opportunities they may find otherwise difficult to. The friends and families are impacted because they may be able to more easily communicate with their loved ones who have hearing loss. 
Furthermore, businesses connected to our research can include hearing aid manufacturers, as well as ones that are involved in machine learning and language detection. Hearing aid manufacturers and vendors are tied to our research since our research might impact the cost and methods of hearing aid production. In addition, hearing aid companies are important to our research because they supply the technology and models for how the hearing aids currently being produced appeal to the hearing impaired community. Businesses that are involved in machine learning and language detection may also be connected to our research because they can help generate the algorithm behind how hearing aids detect sound.
